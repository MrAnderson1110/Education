Everyone could notice that people often complain and say that it was better before. 
It may be a little nostalgia; the old people would like to return in the 50s, forty-years-old people prefer the 70s. 
It can be explained of the life period when they were younger. 
As it’s known people like their youth time. In general living is better now. 
We live when there aren’t as many wars in the world as before. 
And people live longer; the level of lifespan is higher than it was 40 years ago. 
People work less and they can afford to go to the vacation and buy more things.
